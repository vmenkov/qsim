Qsim - Multiline screening simulation application

<h2>User Guide</h2>

<p>There are three applications included in this distribution
<ul>
<li>Batch simulator
<li>GUI simulator
<li>Arrival schedule generator
</ul>

<h3>Using the batch simulator</h3>

<p><strong>With dynamic arrival generation.</strong>
Run simulation 10 times; model described by the configuration file config10.dat; output goes to directory outx.

<pre>
java -Druns=10  -cp lib/qsim.jar qsim.Qsim config10.dat outx
</pre>

The output directory will contain 1 output file per run.

If the name of the destination directory is omitted, a directory with a [nearly] unique name, such as <tt>out-qsim-2016-05-23_01-49-43</tt> will be automatically created.

<pre><strong>With pre-computed arrival schedule files.</strong>
java -Druns=5 -Darrivals=schedule-dir -cp lib/qsim.jar qsim.Qsim config10.dat outx
</pre>

<p>Here, the simulator will disregard the customer numebr (nGenMax) and the arrival rate found in the configuration file. Instead of generating the customer arrival schedule dynamically, each run will use a schedule file from the specified directory, which in this example is <tt>schedule-dir</tt>. 

<p>The schedule file directory must contain at least as many schedule file as the specified number of runs. E.g. with -Druns=5, that directory must contain files named <tt>arrivals-000</tt> thru  <tt>arrivals-005</tt>. If there are more files than that, any extra files will be ignored.

<p>
<strong>Arrival schedule files.</strong>
Files like this can be produced by the Arrvial schedule generator (see below). You can also produce them manually, e.g. with a Python or Perl script. To see the file format, run the arrival generator and take a look at the files it produces.

<p>
The file is space-separated (actually, TAB-separated, but any white space will work). The format of each line is as follows,
<pre>
time lane threat
</pre>
Here <em>time</em> is the arrival time (a non-negative long integer); <em>lane</em> is the lane number (1-based, from 1 thru L); <em>threat</em> is 0 or 1. In the files produced by the Arrival schedule generator, lines are arranged chronologically (non-decreasing time), with the lane number as a secondary key.

<p>If you generate a schedule file yourself, you don't have to arrange the lines in this way; you can, for example, use the lane number as a primary key for ordring. The only requirement is that the lines for a given lane number, wherever they appear in the file, appear in a chronological order (non-decreasing time).

<p><strong>Additional options</strong>

<pre>
-Dspeed=100  simulation speed (so many units of simulation time per
    one second of real time). Use 0 to run simulation fast (without
     regard to the wall clock).
-DT=-1   Time limit. If the value is negative, it is ignored, and the
    simulation runs until it runs out of customers in all lanes. 
    If T is non-negative, the simulation will stop after T units of 
    simulated time, or when it runs out of customer, whichever happens sooner.
-Dseed=0   seed for the random number generator
</pre>

<h3>Using the GUI simulator</h3>

<pre>
rungui.sh 
</pre>
or
<pre>
java -cp lib/qsim.jar qsim.gui.QsimGUI
</pre>

<p>To run a simulation, start with loading a config file using the File menu. Then, optionally, you can load an arrival schedule file. (Since, unlike the batch simulator, you cannot carry out multiple runs, you need to choose a single file, not a directory. You can pick any file from a directory produced by the arrival schedule generator). Then click on "Run". You can stop and resume simulation at will with the "Stop" and "Run" buttons; you can also "break" and "fix" lanes. (This can be done with or without stopping the simulator).

<p>The simulation speed, and the time limit (if any) can be controlled via the Options menu.

<p><strong>Resetting simulation.</strong> You can reset the simulator by reading a config file (the same one or a different one) again, or by loading an arrival file.


<h3>Using the arrvial schedule generator</h3>

<p>The arrival schedule generator is a separate tool which can be used to prepare an arrival schedule file which later can be used by the batch simulator or GUI simulator.

<pre>
java -Druns=10 -cp lib/qsim.jar qsim.GenerateArrivals config10.dat out-dir
</pre>

This will create 10 schedule files, in the directory out-dir, named <tt>arrivals-000</tt> thru  <tt>arrivals-009</tt>. 

<p>If the output directory name is omitted, a name, such as arrivals-qsim-2016-05-25_23-59-03 will be automatically generated.

<p>The number of customers in each file (nGenMax) and arrival rate for each lane (lambda) are taken from the config file.

<p>Additional options:

<pre>
-Dseed=0   seed for the random number generator
</pre>
