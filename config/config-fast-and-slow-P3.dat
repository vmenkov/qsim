#-- This example demonstrates how with dynamic assignment of profiles
#-- (policy P3) the resources may be allocated more efficiently.
#-- Unlike with P1, no significant backlog forms.

#-- number of lanes
L=10

#-- Lambda, the avg frequence of customer arrival (per second)
lambda=0.10
#-- The number of customers to be generated per each lane. (0 means infinite)
nGenMax=0
#-- Fraction of "bad" customers among the arrivals (in [0,1] range)
fracBad=0.2
dAcceptable=0.4

#-- policy P3 means dynamic assignment on the "ticket box" system
policy=P3


# The options for counting (or not counting) the currently-processed user
# when measuring the queue length: YES, NO, PARTIALLY. The "PARTIALLY"
# option should result in a sensible tie-breaking when ranking lanes
# by queue length.
policy.countCurrentlyScreened=PARTIALLY

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
#-- One or more screening profiles. They should be listed in the order
#-- of increasing detection rate and decreasing average processing time.
#-- Screening profile No. 1, with prefix "p1". A fast profile
p1.L=2
p1.M=4
p1.H=6
p1.d=0.3

#-- Screening profile No. 2, with prefix "p2". A slow profile
p2.L=10
p2.M=20
p2.H=30
p2.d=0.8
